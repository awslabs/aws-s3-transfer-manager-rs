/*

A resolver that uses shared state to distribute IPs to resolution requests
from arbitrary sources.  This allows us to properly implement SRA-style name resolution which
has round-robin IP distribution shared across all threads/runtimes interested in establishing
connections to a given name.  This resolver can be shared across a transfer manager's runtime
threads, multiple SDK clients, etc...

Shared state via explicit mutual exclusion is a nightmare, so we use a channel-based
CSP architecture.

The resolver can only be interacted with via a communication channel that can contain resolution
requests, results, and more.  A lightweight recurrent async task loops on that channel's receiver
processing incoming operations.  This creates a natural "serialization" of all resolution
requests regardless of source/location, with an associated private shared state for bookkeeping.

Currently, the async processing task behaves as follows:

On a resolution request:
   If we have good IPs for that name, resolve the request with the least-used good IP
   If there are

      1. no good IPs for that name or
      2. it's been a while since we last resolved that name

      and no resolution is pending, kick off a resolution on the resolver's runtime.  If the
      request was not resolved earlier, park the request until a resolution returns a result.

On a resolution result:
   Process the list of IPs returned, adding new ones to the good IP set for that name and refreshing
     the TTL on existing ones.
   For all parked requests on that name, complete the request with a good IP (by least-used priority)
     or the error if the resolution failed.

On a host event:
   On connection error:
      If the error is fatal, remove the ip address from consideration permanently
      If the error is major, mark the ip address as unhealthy for a time period based on
        the TTL for lookups.  Unhealthy IPs cannot be used to answer resolve requests.  Unhealthy
        IPs can be prematurely promoted back to healthy if no healthy IPs exist.

On IP TTL expiration:
   Remove the ip from the resolver cache completely

IP TTL expiration (or promotion) is processed lazily.
